**Bubble Sort**

It is comparison sorting algorithms that starts at the beginning and compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. O(n^2).

**Merge Sort**

It is a divide and conquer algorithm. It divides the array into equal halves and then combines them in a sorted manner. O(n log n)

**Selection Sort**

The algorithm scans the array for the smallest item and moves it to the front. Then, repeat for rest items. O(n^2)
